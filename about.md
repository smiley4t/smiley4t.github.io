## My Interests

In terms of academic and professional interests, I am passionate about **Mathematics, Coding, Technology, AI, and Data**. I hope to apply **AI and Big Data** to solve real-world problems that matter.  

Since high school, I have always felt fascinated by mathematics — especially logic, patterns, and problem-solving. I achieved **Third Prize twice in the National Mathematics Contest**, which strengthened my confidence in analytical thinking. When I discovered Data and AI and realized how powerful they could be in real applications, I knew this was the path I wanted to pursue. My long-term dream is to become a **Data Scientist**.

Outside of academics, I am an energetic person who loves sports — especially **swimming, running, badminton, and pickleball**. I believe training the body is similar to training the mind: a healthy body supports a strong mindset and good mental health.

I also love **traveling and discovering new places**. Since coming to Australia, I have been amazed by its natural beauty — truly unlike anywhere else in the world.

Reading is another big part of my life. I enjoy **novels** and **self-help books**. For me, reading opens new perspectives and rewires the mind. It is also why I enjoy **writing journals** — to reflect, track my growth, and understand myself better.
Some of my favourite books:
