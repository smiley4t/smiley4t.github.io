## Data Projects

This page showcases selected projects where I apply **data science, data analysis, visualization, and storytelling** to real-world problems.  
Each project focuses not only on tools, but also on **how data is transformed into insights**.

</p>

**Tools:** Tableau, Excel  
**Focus:** Data visualization, comparative analysis, storytelling

This is a project I built interactive dashboards to compare **GDP, GDP average growth, region share of world GDP by year** of different countries and regions. Based on that, I can figure out insights of global GDP during 1995 - 2024 and discover emerging economy in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

</p>

**Tools:** Tableau, Data Cleaning, Excel  
**Focus:** Data visualization, comparative analysis, storytelling

I had a chance to volunteer for a project to research on immigration of Colac Otway - a regional area in the south west of Melbourne. I collected data from Australian Bureau of Statistics of two regions Colac Otway and Geelong to visualize the population, religion, job sectors,.etc
